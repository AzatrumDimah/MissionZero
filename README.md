# MissionZero
This project was a submission for the Innocentive Ideation Challenge on the topic "Gamification to model social behaviours during a pandemic". The repository contains a pdf which explains the game play of the proposed game and the mathematical model used to model the pandemic ,and its social and economic consequences in the game. There is also a console based application made with C++ as a proof of concept for the mathematical model.

This project was creted by me Murtaza Mustafa Hamid with my batchmate at IIST Prakhar Gupta.
